  - `word-spacing` and `letter-spacing`
  - `line-height`
  - `link`, `visited`, `hover`, and `active`
  - `transition` (in this case, to create more sophisticated hover effects with animations and delays).
  - `transform` (in this case, to zoom in and out on an image).
  - `text-decoration: none;` for removing link underlines.
  - `linear-gradient` for shading background images.
  - `list-style: none;` for removing bullet points from lists.
  - `text-transform: uppercase;` to make all letters capital. `text-transform: capitalize` to capitalize only the first letter of each word.
  - `background-attachment: fixed;` to hold a background image in place, even when the user scrolls.
  - `content` to add text to the site using CSS3.
